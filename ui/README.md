# Scholar Reader Interface

An interactive PDF reader, that utilizes Semantic Scholar's 
data and corpus to provide a novel reading experience to 
researchers. More to come soon ðŸŽ‰.

To launch the development version of this server, first make 
sure that the pdf.js submodule has been downloaded:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Install the dependencies for the npm.js submodule:

```bash
cd public/pdf.js  # enter the pdf.js submodule directory
npm install       # install dependencies
```

Then, install the dependencies for the rest of the project 
by changing back to the directory containing this README, 
and then calling:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can launch the app as follows:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm start  # 3001 is the port number. Save port 3000
                     # for the development API server.
```

A web browser should open automatically to open the app. You 
won't see much interesting at first, as no PDF has been 
loaded. Load a PDF by entering the following URL in the URL 
bar: 
`http://localhost:3001/?file=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.4750.pdf`.

You can in theory provide the URL for any PDF as the value 
of the `file` query parameter. That said, at the time this 
README was written, there was only a few PDFs for which the 
augmented reading experience is available.

If you are testing out the application, you should also make 
sure that the API server is running on port 3000. See the 
README in the `api/` sibling directory for instructions.

The React app is implemented in the `src/` directory.
