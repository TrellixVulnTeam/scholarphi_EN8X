SLE patients with a mild involvement can be easily managed with a low dose of oral steroids (to be discontinued as soon as possible), hydroxychloroquine, and symptomatic drugs. Moderate to severe manifestations usually require the addition of DMARDs and immunosuppressants, like methotrexate, mofetil mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, or the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins. The use of biologic agents (belimumab or rituximab) is indicated in refractory forms of disease. SLE flares are treated with intravenous steroid pulses and prevented with long-term low doses of oral glucocorticoids. In addition, symptomatic or organ-specific drugs, like analgesics, antihypertensive or antiepileptic agents, are often co-prescribed. In case of a concomitant APS diagnosis, anti-thrombotic and anti-coagulant drugs, and, in severe forms, plasma exchange, may also be needed. Darker color in the bars indicates higher doses or a more common use of the referred medications.

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women.

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

They include blood, urine, and imaging tests.Early kidney disease usually does not have signs or symptoms. Testing is the only way to know how your kidneys are doing. It is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors - diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure.Specific kidney tests includeGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) - one of the most common blood tests to check for chronic kidney disease. It tells how well your kidneys are filtering.Creatinine blood and urine tests - check the levels of creatinine, a waste product that your kidneys remove from your bloodAlbumin urine test - checks for albumin, a protein that can pass into the urine if the kidneys are damagedImaging tests, such as an ultrasound - provide pictures of the kidneys. The pictures help the health care provider see the size and shape of the kidneys, and check for anything unusual.Kidney biopsy - a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope.

                "Animal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African American, Hispanic American, and Native American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response."

You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "Animal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

                "Animal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk.

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go.

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment.

Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African American, Hispanic American, and Native American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response."

                "Animal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.Farm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. "

                "What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupusSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones arePain or swelling in jointsMuscle painFever with no known causeRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")Chest pain when taking a deep breathHair lossPale or purple fingers or toesSensitivity to the sunSwelling in legs or around eyesMouth ulcersSwollen glandsFeeling very tiredSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.How is lupus diagnosed?There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:Medical historyComplete examBlood testsSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)What are the treatments for lupus?There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.The goals of the treatment plan are toPrevent flaresTreat flares when they occurReduce organ damage and other problemsTreatments may include drugs toReduce swelling and painPrevent or reduce flaresHelp the immune systemReduce or prevent damage to jointsBalance the hormonesBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.How can I cope with lupus?It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"
