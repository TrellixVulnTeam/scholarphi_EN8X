# Paths to TeX compilers and libraries. Required for AutoTeX to know what tools
# to use when it attempts to automatically compile TeX projects. The current
# paths are the defaults if you have installed TeXLive on Ubuntu Bionic using
# 'apt-get install -y texlive-full', as is done for the Docker container.
#
# If you have installed LaTeX on your computer in some other way, these paths
# probably need to be different. One way to find out what these paths should be
# is to do a system-wide search for the 'texmf-dist' and 'pdflatex' binaries
# (e.g., using a utility like 'locate' on OSX).
[tex]
# This directory should contain a 'texmf-dist' subdirectory.
texlive_path = /usr/share/texlive/
# This is the directory that contains the 'pdflatex' and 'latex' binaries.
texlive_bin_path = /usr/bin/

# Path to Perl. Perl is used by the data processing scripts to invoke AutoTeX.
# It cannot be a recent version (AutoTeX uses deprecated language features).
# Delete this section if you want the scripts to use your system's default Perl.
# The current value is the path to Perl installed in the Docker container.
