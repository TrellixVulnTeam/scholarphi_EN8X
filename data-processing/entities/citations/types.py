    The 'id_' field of a Bibitem should be the key of the bibitem.

    For bibitems, the start and end position in TeX should be set to -1 (an invalid value)

    pipeline because a custom colorization function is used for citations. A custom
    colorization function is desired because citations are colorized dynamically by running
    some setup commands in the document preamble, instead of surrounding ranges of text
