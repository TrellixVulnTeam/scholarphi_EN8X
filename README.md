# scholar-reader

An interactive PDF reader, that utilizes Semantic Scholar's data and corpus to provide a novel reading experience to researchers.

This project is being developed in collaboration with UC Berkeley.

More to come soon ðŸŽ‰.

# Build instructions

The React app is implemented in the `src/` directory. You
should (in theory: TODO Andrew verify) be able to test it
standalone by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

The project can be packaged as a Chrome extension. This is
done with `create-react-app`, and Webpack, which compile the
files into a standalone set of pages and scripts that will
be loaded by the Chrome extension when a PDF page is visited
(currently only arXiv).

To compile the files, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then you can load the directory for this project as an
"unpacked" extension into Chrome.

## Development quirks

The indexes of the chunks generated by webpack are
hard-coded in `extension/app.html`, even though these chunk
indexes might change in future builds. We should configure
webpack to generate chunks with known, stable indexes.

The `extension/pdf.worker.js` file may need to be downloaded
again as the `pdf.js` pdf.worker.js is changed.
